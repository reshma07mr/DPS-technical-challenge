Problem statement - Vowel counter.
Words are composed of two types of letters, vowels and consonants. For purposes of our problem, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' are vowels, and all other letters are consonants. Given a String word, return the number of vowels it contains.

The solution to this code is done using Python programming language, Used Python version 3.8.10. No extra packages or dependencies are used.

Steps to be done :
1. Define a function.
2. Accept the string and convert it to either lower or upper case for the ease of comparison.
3. If it is a sentence,remove the whitespace in between the word.
4. Store a variable named "vowel", with all vowel letters (a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u').
5. Write a function where if a character present in the given string is a charatceer present in the vowel, the count it.
6. Display the number of characters counted lie this.
7. Create a git repository , add the program file, commit the changes if any, push it.

To run the code locally, go to terminal run the commnd "python3 filelocation/filename" (any Python IDE an be used alternatievely).
